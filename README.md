# Computational-fluid-dynamics-CFD
This repository contains a collection of small-scale CFD solvers and example problems implemented in MATLAB and Python. The goal is to build an educational, modular, and open set of codes that demonstrate how fundamental CFD algorithms are developed from first principles.
