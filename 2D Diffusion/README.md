This work demonstrates the implementation of the Finite Volume Method (FVM) in MATLAB for solving a 2D diffusion problem. All MATLAB scripts are organized within the MATLAB codes folder, along with the corresponding reports. The sections below provide an overview of the governing equations, the discretization strategies employed, and a discussion of the obtained results.

The Governing diffusion equation for temperature T (i.e., heat conduction equation), which can be written as,
